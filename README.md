The Audiotebook App

Itâ€™s a mobile app which allows the user to make audio recordings that, via a simple interface, the reporter can annotate with structured information. Some it can be generated automatically: start and end times, date, geolocation. Other elements must be entered manually: whom the interviewee is (though this is a one time heavy manual entry, i.e. entering all the details of the person, and then simply requires picking a name from a list on every other occasion), the story slug (a journalism shorthand form of story labelling), photographs etc. This data is then transmitted to the web app with all the media attached.
